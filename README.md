# Unofficial Wearheart API

## Introduction
My obsession with ECG haven't worn off yet, from the last project I use AD8232 module with Arduino but the issue is I've got to attach all the wires and leads to my body. So I search around any alternative for ECG wearable, I do own iwatch but pretty much useless right now for ECG and they even disabled HRV for watch bought from Malaysia. Luckily I found relatively inexpensive smart watch that support not only ECG but blood pressure.
